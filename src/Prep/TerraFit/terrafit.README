Attached find a revised Python script to drive Terra as a direct
replacement for ArrayFit

To use this you will need to install Terra available @
http://graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/~garland/software/terra.html

The direct link to the source code is:
http://graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/~garland/dist/terra-0.7.tar.gz

This should run *considerably* faster.
 < order(s) of magnitude + >

This speedup is due a sosphisticated 'search space' cacheing scheme 
in Terra so that the entire point set does not have to be searched per 
iteration

Note the resulting surface should be *very* close to what the original 
ArrayFit routine produces in that basic algorithm used is the same

terrafit.py --help for usage ( same as original program )

Enjoy
