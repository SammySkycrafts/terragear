 
0.2 is an extensive rewrite featuring 

(1) Texturing on airspace with useful information such as call signs and frequencies for controlling agencies for special use airspace.
(2) Terminal waypoints associated with airports are displayable as well as glide slopes (black for three degree vfr, red for ILS glideslopes with 
the glideslope angle as specified in the database.  The outer upper boundary onthe glide slope is one degree above the glideslope.
(3) circles, arcs, and lines have been dissected into lists of lines and distributed accross the various tiles.  By dividing the graphics files 
among the tiles large arcs for Class B airspace for example become visable as soon as the tile comes into view.  T he first version would not display until
the center of the circle come into view....
(4) Added signage for (a) airports, (b) navaids, (c) waypoints (d) terminal waypoints (e) special use airspace.  The signage system(s) take advantage of the
billboard feature in flightgear so the signs always turn to face the view.
(5) added a menu system to toggle everything on or off to suit the situational requirements.  Turning everything on for display in the Los Angelus area is 
an excercise in visually getting buried.  

The program can output Class A and E airspace boundaries but they seem to be more of a nuisance visually.  The default setup in the code is to omit A and E
airspace.
