This folder includes a sample  .fgfsrc file which is normally 
in the home directory on linux systems as a hidden file.  

airspace.xml is a menu to control toggling on and off various 
airspace features such as signage, which types of airspace to 
display etc.

menubar.xml is the tweaked version of the flighgear menubar to
add in the airspace.xml menu system.

glide-slope-1nm-by-3d.ac and glide-slope.xml are for displaying 
3 degree glideslopes for runways with known altitudes for the
runway ends.
