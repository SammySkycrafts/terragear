Things I want to do -- CLO

Scenery Creation Bugs
=====================

- Columbia river has a section colored with default material
  (-119.436, 45.920) tile #991738.

- I see lakes that aren't properly flattened

- Add vertex points to tile edges so we reduce the chance of having
  big "W" folds at tile borders.

? Lake Washington (around seattle came out all forest.) Tile #942691.
  Upon some investigation (April 22, 2005) it appears that this is an
  unfortunate side effect of trying to mix GSHSS and VMAP data.  Lake
  Washington is considered a "lake" by GSHHS so it's not part of the
  top level land mass polygons.  However, VMAP connects this to the
  ocean, so it doesn't have it in it's lake data.  We might have to
  consider using just VMAP0 data because GSHHS has problems with the
  great lakes and other places ... it's great for shorelines though
  and *much* better than VMAP which is really disappointing ...

x Fixed a bug in tgChopNormalPolygon that could leave big chunks out
  of the final output.

x Some areas not getting colored right now that we went to this 400m segment
  length (pick biggest triangle for point inside, but not in a hole?)
  For instance, LFPG should be surrounded by farmland, but comes out
  only with default.

  This appears to be a problem with TGVPF which calls the "wrong"
  polygon chop routine.  The one it called leveraged a simplisted
  polygon splitter which couldn't handle multi-contour polygons or
  polygons with holes.  This led to some incorrect output which is
  hopefully now fixed.  So I guess it was not so much a problem with
  tgvpf, but an underlying library function it called.

x a big hole in the Florida scenery around 26deg 27' 958"N, 80deg 04'
  855"W.  1X4 has bogus taxiway data which appears to be causing this
  problem.

x (05/13/2004) 2990811 in e002n49 fails to build.  Remove cycles was
  no-oped because a key line was commented out ... not sure why but
  the code was commented out when it was put in ... that probably
  means it was pasted from elsewhere, but I didn't want to dig that
  much to figure out where it might have come from.

x Put original 3 arcsec dem data as a higher priority than the 30 arcsec
  global data.


Airport Generator
=================

- Create heliports with an actual "H" texture (as provided by Melchior.)

- Figure out where the massive memory leak is (probably nurbs++).

- come up with a way to mix in dem terrain elevation changes while
  preserving the published altitude at the end of each runway

x Generate a surface square for towers, beacons, and wind socks to sit on.

x LPMA, LICJ has a problem with skirt nodes.

x Add support for the X-Plane 8.x format

x (11/08/2004) P13 and KBUR have shelves.

x KMIC missing grass runway (database problem) :-(

x KBTM (figure out flaw)

x limit the amount of rate of elevation change (slope) like we do
  for rivers

x (4/26/2004) Figure out airport elevation bug!!!!  (Maybe fixed, need to
  monitor closely during next rebuild.)  Check KSAN, EGNM, KBUR?, KANE, ... 
  We now only average airport points for the airport average height, not the
  whole area ... that broke down when the airport was on a hill or in a bowl,
  or there was a significant elevation change within the area near by.

x (04/06/2004) KABQ has way too much elevation change, need to make better
  limiters (maybe based on slope rather than overall elevation change?)

x KPOC (grass in middle of runway)

x KOXR (grass in middle of runway)

x KTVL (grass area in middle of runway)

x KMRY (grass in middle of runway)

x EPWA (sunken runway)

x (04/06/2004) Fix approach lighting relative to displaced thresholds.

x (10/31/2002) fix problems with skirt being wrong node count

x threshold lighting, group by rwy end, not by viewing direction.

x don't let approach lighting go lower than the altitude of the end of
  the runway

x finish lighting schemes.


Tile Generation
===============

- Put skirts around every hole

- Also do this in the on-the-fly flightgear ocean tile generator.


Model Output
============

- Strippify rather than fan-ify


Roads/Streams
=============

- Cut holes for these, don't let the triangulator split up the edges.

- Make corners into nicer radius?

- Lay a texture down appropriately so that it actually looks like a
  road (stream?)

- Create a logical road network near airports so we can create moving
  traffic?


Mesh Simplification
===================

x Find a more intelligent way to simplify the regular DEM mesh into a
  TIN - terra!


Work Data
==========

- Regenerate Shape-Roads and Shape-Railroads to get the sorted into the right
  directories.

x Regenerate DEM30 data (new code doesn't generate areas that are all
  0 elevation saving a ton of space.)
